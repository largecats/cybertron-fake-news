Earlier today, Shockwave - former Senator in Functionalist Cybertron and newly appointed President of the Iacon Science Academy - shared in a press conference on the discovery of a novel silicon-based virus. This is the first official statement released after the first suspected case emerged in Kaon during the last lunar cycle. Up till now, there have been 7 confirmed cases, 5 out of which have healed, while 2 still remain in medical bay. All cases were detected and confirmed in Kaon, and precautions have been made to prevent any chance of spread.

"The virus, albeit novel, is of a familiar silicon base." Shockwave said during the press conference. "Its footprint has been identified and it properties analyzed," and contrary to rumours, "there is no evidence suggesting that the virus has developed the capability to infect carbon-based life forms. However, he added that consdering the prevalence of mechanical and electrical reforms among our carbon-based allies such as humans on earth, it is recommended to maintain good cybersecurity practices and avoid interfacing with untrusted devices.
